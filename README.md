# 1DCSEM
This is code for modelling of 1D controlled source electromagnetics for multilayered media. The code is partial implementation of Loseth, L and B. Ursin, “Electromagnetic fields in planarly layered anisotropic media,” Geophys. J. Int., 2007. The code is implemented specially in cosideration of marine CSEM, where both source ans reciever are located in second layer (sea water).
